# The Gold IDE
### The Gold IDE is a lightweight IDE for [i-use-arch-btw programming language](https://github.com/overmighty/i-use-arch-btw) made in Java.

You can build the IDE from sources(Intelij recommened), i-use-arch-btw is required for running.

### Note: input( **by** kewyord) makes the whole IDE stop for now.
